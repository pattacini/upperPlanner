# reaching-with-avoidance
===
## Synopsis

- **`reaching-with-avoidance`** is a completed solution to plan and monitor operation of iCub arm. It includes some modules for path planning generation and supervisor the movement of iCub arm, as describing in detail as following:

	- **`reaching-planner`** is a module to generate a motion plan for an arm of the iCub, based on the Incremental Sampling-based Algorithm - RRT* [1], [2]. A path plan includes the End-effector and the Elbow in the Forearm, generated by trigger from rpc command. The planner can operate alone or in combination with supervisor. The details of algorithm is described in the published paper [3].
	- **`reaching-supervisor`** is a module to handle the communication between the `reaching-planner`, the `reactController` and user through yarp communication protocol.

## Dependencies
- [YARP](https://github.com/robotology/yarp)
- [iCub](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main)
- [icub-contrib-common](https://github.com/robotology/icub-contrib-common)
- [reactController](https://github.com/robotology/react-control) 
- [peripersonal-space](https://github.com/robotology/peripersonal-space) (PPS): optional for real-time avoidance behavior
- [objectsPropertiesCollector](http://wiki.icub.org/brain/group__objectsPropertiesCollector.html) (OPC): optional for running with real robot.
- [WYSIWYD](https://github.com/robotology/wysiwyd): optional for running with PPS. In particular, the following modules are required:
	- *opcPopulater*: to create fake objects in OPC
	- *sensationManager*
	- *homeostasis*
	- *allostaticController*
	- *behaviorManager*

## Commands
- For the operation with `reaching-planner` only:
	- By sending commands through yarp rpc port, we can trigger the planner to generate a plan based on the environment perception,
i.e: `yarp rpc /<planner_module_name>/rpc:i`.

	- Command for replan: `replan <deadline>`, with `<deadline>` is the maximum exploration time of each planner.

- For the operation with `reaching-supervisor`:
	- By using rpc service to communicate with the supervisor, i.e: `yarp rpc /<supervisor_module_name>/rpc:i`.

## Applications:
- In simulation:
	- For **reaching only**: [multiple-Cartesian-point_localhost.xml](https://github.com/robotology-playground/reaching-planner/blob/devel/app/script/multiple-Cartesian-point_localhost.xml)
	- For **reaching with avoidance**: [planner_reactCtrl_PPS_localhost.xml](https://github.com/robotology-playground/reaching-planner/blob/devel/app/script/planner_reactCtrl_PPS_localhost.xml)
- How to run:
	- Run all modules in scripted application. Remember running the `iCub_SIM` first for simulation case.
	- Connect all modules.
	- Open a terminal and connect to *reactController* and make *reactController* receive references from *supervisor*: 
		```
		yarp rpc /reactController/rpc:i	
		set_streaming_xd
		```
	- Open a terminal and connect to *reaching-supervior* as described in [Commands](https://github.com/robotology-playground/reaching-planner/tree/devel#commands) 
	- Query a new motion plan and control the arm for reaching by sending commands to *reaching-supervisor* as described in [Documentation](https://github.com/robotology-playground/reaching-planner/tree/devel#documentation). Some useful rpc commands can be listed here:

		- `run_planner <deadline>`, to plan and move arm to a target in *objectsPropertiesCollector* that shown in front of robot. Target can be modified by `set_target <name>`
		- `run_planner_pos <Vector of 3D position> <deadline>`, to plan and move arm to a position. 
		- `stop`, to stop moving the arm.
		- `resume`, to continue moving the arm after stopping.

	- In order to see the effect of **PPS**, open a terminal and connect to *opcPopulater*:
		```
		yarp rpc /opcPopulater/rpc
		populateSpecific3
		```

	- Then open a terminal and connect to *OPC* to modulate objects' name an position. Following example change the name of `unknown_2` object to `hand`(of other agent) to make *PPS* take into account the hand's position, then move it to change the effect of *PPS* on the motion of arm. The expected effect will be the robot's arm is approaching a desired position then stopping if the partner's hand move to and interfere the motion path of robot's arm.
		```
		yarp rpc /OPC/rpc
		set ((id 2) (name hand))
		set ((id 2) (robot_position_x -0.3) (robot_position_y -0.15) (robot_position_z 0.05))
		set ((id 2) (robot_position_x -0.8) (robot_position_y -0.15) (robot_position_z 0.05))
		```
